		<p><h1>The Old Fairlane Rides Again</h1></p>
		<div id="imgright"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_01.jpg"></div>
		<p>My 1966 Ford Fairlane GT was purchased new (ordered) from Crown Ford in Nashville, Tennessee by Jim Oakley in October of 1965. The car was delivered a couple of months later, on January 13, 1966. Jim and his brother Bob had both ordered the new-style “stacked headlight” Fairlane, Bob opting for the automatic GTA version in red, Jim for this silver, four-speed GT model. Bob’s came in right away, Jim’s silver four-speed took a couple of months.</p>

		<p>Just eleven months later, Jim reluctantly traded the car back to Oak Motors (after putting a quick 16,500 miles on the car) because a salesman talked him into it. Jim was getting married and the salesman convinced him that this four-speed “musclecar” was not suitable as a family vehicle. Jim thinks that the salesman had a buyer for a ‘66 GT and was on the lookout for one. Jim happened to come by the dealership that day, so he became “the one”. Jim believes this because he tried to back out of the deal, but couldn’t. During his drive home from the dealership in the new car he came to regret his decision to trade in the Fairlane. Jim called the dealership to try to reverse the deal, but the salesman would have none of it. Jim even offered to let the dealership keep the down payment in compensation for the use of the new car driven away by him that day, but the dealership would not consider his request.</p>

		<p>My father bought this car for my older brother Scott that same month, so maybe he was the guy that had the salesman on the lookout. (Dad has since passed away, so we can’t ask him about it.) My brother drove this Fairlane during his junior and senior year of college at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. When he was about to get married following graduation in 1968, he traded it to me. I drove this Fairlane through my senior year at Two Rivers High School in Nashville, and four years of college in nearby Lebanon and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Just as many kids are known by the car they drive, I was fairly well known in high school because of this car. My buddies and I named the car “Fred”…as in “Fast, fearless, faithful Freddy Ford Fairlane”. Goofy, but that’s what it was. I didn’t know, as a kid at the time, but I have since learned that it had a Ford series “FE” engine in it, so all the “F’s” were truly appropriate!</p>

		<p>The Fairlane, with its big 390 cubic inch engine and four barrel carburetor never did get very good fuel mileage (about 12 miles per gallon) but it didn’t seem to matter at the time. Gasoline sold for twenty to thirty cents per gallon and I had signing privileges on our family account at the neighborhood Texaco station. But when I started graduate school during the “gas crunch” times of 1974, my grandmother bought me a used BMW 2002 and I stopped driving the Fairlane. It just stayed parked in various places in and around my mother’s house in Nashville.</p>

		<p>In 1976, following graduate school and some teaching in the public schools, I accepted a job with American Suzuki Motor Corporation (U.S. Suzuki at the time) that required I move out of state. I hurriedly put the Fairlane in storage in a neighbor’s ramshackle barn. I put concrete blocks under the suspension and filled the engine up with oil, through the spark plug holes and even through the carburetor! I mean the engine was FILLED.</p>
		<div id="imgleft"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_02.jpg"></div>
		<p>From time to time during the following years an old school buddy of mine kept bugging me to sell the Fairlane to him. I had transferred to California by 1979 but didn’t really want to sell the car. I finally relented and agreed to give him half the car IF he would get it out of the barn, get it running and keep it in good shape so I could drive it whenever I returned to Tennessee for family visits. So in 1987 he took it out of storage from the barn and drained all that oil. He said that after spinning the engine over with the plugs out for a few minutes, it fired right up!</p>

		<p>My buddy cleaned the car up (even the moldy and terribly dirty interior) and got the car running fairly well. He entered it in some small car shows in and around middle Tennessee, and he took home a few trophies…mostly due its originality and rarity. (Most folks were not “into” the Fords at that time. It was pretty rare to see a car like this in a show.) My buddy kept it in good shape and we even drove it to our 20 year high school reunion in the spring of 1989. Everyone was surprised to see the same old crew in the same old car…my Fairlane!</p>
		
		<p>But then my old friend lost interest in maintaining this car, and began to neglect it. During the next 20 years he did not pay much attention to Fred…first storing it here, then there, then outside, then someplace else. By 1999 the car had become a derelict again. It had not been started in ten years, the battery was dead, the tires flat, the brake fluid and engine oil were terribly aged., the paint was peeling, the windows were dark with dirt and there were leaks here and there. All in all, my old Ford was in pretty bad shape.<p>

		<p>From time to time I would talk to my friend and discuss the possibility of selling the car. Bob Oakley, the original owner had made inquiries about it from time to time, and we were tempted to sell it. But I would procrastinate and just not make any decision. Then one day in the fall of 2000 my buddy called me, wanting to get the car out of his garage and off his property! What was I to do with this old derelict car, it being in middle Tennessee and me living 2000 miles away in California? My daughter had seen the car and wanted us to drive it to California one day. Perhaps this was the time to do something about that!</p>

		<p>I asked my buddy to pump up the tires enough to get it on a trailer and delivered to my Mother’s condo garage in nearby Hermitage, Tennessee. I started thinking more and more about getting the car fixed up enough to drive out to California (after all, I had driven it, and it was nice, back in 1989 to that 20 year reunion…how bad could it be?). But I did not want to just have it towed to just any local mechanic for refurbishment. I didn’t have the budget for that, but more importantly I wanted someone familiar with these old Fairlanes to do the work.</p>

		<p>Soon after the car was dropped off at my Mom’s, my brother sent me a link to a Fairlane parts website, and from that I found a link to the Fairlane Club of America (http://fairlaneclubofamerica.com). I e-mailed the Editor and the President of the club (two different guys) and asked them “How can I locate a club member in Middle Tennessee that would be willing to get this car in running shape again so I can drive it to California?” I explained its condition and estimated that it would take about 100 hobby hours to get the car “in shape” for a trip like that, and I would gladly pay the club member a reasonable fee to do the work. I thought the 100 hours would cover putting several hundred “shake-down” miles on the car so it would be sure to be O.K. for the trip west.</p>

		<p>Within 30 minutes club founder and newsletter Editor Bob Mannel e-mailed me back. His message was fairly short, but pretty darn sweet: “I’ll be happy to do that, for the cost of parts and a steak dinner for me and my wife.” WOW, I thought, how great is that?</p>

		<div id="imgright"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_03.jpg"></div><p>But then, after the initial euphoria, I thought “Wait a minute…I don’t know this guy from Adam…this could be one of those “Deliverance” moments…this guy is in the hills of East Tennessee…how am I to know that he is trustworthy and won’t just sell this car, or part it out or ????” I could go to pick up the car and be greeted with “WHAT car, boy?” Just as these seeds of doubt firmly formed in my mind, Bob told me he was going to be traveling through Nashville the NEXT WEEKEND and wanted to pick it up! This was all happening way too fast. But I needed to make a decision, and wanted it to be the right one, so I stalled for time and called my brother Scott. After some discussion, he asked me to wait and see what we could work out, so I put Bob off until I could learn more about him.</p>

		<p>Within a few weeks, Bob made a trip to visit his daughter in Riverside (near where I live in Anaheim) and we had a chance to visit. During that time, I found out that he was a retired Naval Aviator (he says “attack jet pilot”, but most of us say “fighter pilot”!) and donated his time in retirement to the Fairlane Club and to Moody Aviation (they help Christian missionaries with planes and training). Bob had written a thoroughly complete book on the small-block Ford engine (http://www.fordsmallblock.com) and was nationally known in Mustang restoration circles. So I figured he must be O.K. to work on my car. I gave him the go-ahead, and he very graciously offered to pick my car up the next time he was going through Nashville.</p>

		<p>Within weeks, Bob had picked the car up, trailered it the five or six hours back to his home and workshop in east Tennessee and began work on it almost immediately. I think the first item of concern was a leaking pinion seal on the differential, so he disassembled the differential and rebuilt it! I was surprised, and a little concerned to learn that Bob had pulled the engine out of the car fairly soon upon arrival. He took the oil pan off to replace the leaking gasket and discovered some nylon chips from the cam drive gear in the oil pan. The cam drive gear was obviously coming apart, so Bob and I decided he would rebuild the engine. One thing led to another (over and over, about a hundred times) and pretty soon Bob had completely rebuilt the entire chassis and drive train! I mean he rebuilt the engine, transmission, differential, axles, brakes, and suspension…the whole works!</p>

		<p>Neither of us had envisioned this level of involvement. We were WAY over that “hundred hobbyist hours” that I had predicted it would take. But Bob had editorialized in the Fairlane Club magazine about Fairlane Club members helping each other, and I was learning that he not only “talks the talk”, but he truly does “walk the walk” of a Fairlane Club member. Bob was helping me, and helping me keep a Fairlane on the road. (I think he had fun doing this, too. At least I sure hope so!) The price remained…cost of parts (usually at a steep discount from retail) and one steak dinner for him and his wife.</p>

		<p>Bob was unbelievably detailed and conscientious in his work on this car. Many, many times we would have e-mail conversations about a choice to make. My tendency was to take the short, easy route, but invariably Bob would convince me to do the right thing, do it the right way with the correct parts. He could so very easily have scrimped on this or that (a hundred times), but he didn’t. He even took the time and effort to build a fader control for the rear deck speaker I had installed back in my high school days. And install a backup light switch on my Hurst shifter. And make sure all the screws in the carburetor were exactly the right ones. And change the speedometer drive gear in my transmission to correct my speedometer reading. Bob even disassembled all the under-dash heater and vent assemblies and controls, cleaned, adjusted and re-installed them. Time and time again, he would find a detail he was not happy with, and correct it.</p>

		<p>t was about this time that I told Bob that he was up to TWO steak dinners for he and his wife!</p>

		<p>Sometime during the early stages of Bob’s work on my car, I discovered the “FE Forum” on the internet. I started “lurking”, watching what others were saying, learning all about the big-block Ford engine of the sixties. (”FE” stands for Ford-Edsel…the Ford “big block” engine series from 1958 to 1973.) Frequently I would see something that I thought might apply to my car or engine and forward it to Bob, or ask him about it. I’m sure he had no end of frustration with my meddling, but if he did he never let on. Bob was always and without fail extremely gracious and patient with me.</p>
		<div id="imgleft"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_04.jpg"></div>
		<p>In the fall of 2002, after over one year’s work, Bob was finished with the total mechanical refurbishment of the car. As luck would have it, I had a business trip to Kentucky at about the same time, so I could be in the area to pick it up. After arriving in Knoxville, my brother and I drove to Church Hill to meet Bob and pick up the car. We had a great visit with Bob and his lovely wife Jane. We toured the aviation operations at Moody and presented Bob with some special tools and equipment that I thought he would like. We ended the visit with a trip to best steakhouse in Kingsport, as agreed. We then drove the Fairlane into the night, back to Knoxville.</p>

		<p>I was absolutely amazed at how tight, smooth and quiet the car was. I had been mentally prepared for an “old car”, one that was loose and sloppy with vague steering and weak brakes. But this car was tight and very, very nice. Bob had done a terrific job on it! And the sound of those cubic inches rumbling out the dual exhausts was sweet, sweet forgotten music to my ears.</p>

		<p>In addition to the great mechanical work, Bob had cleaned the car up very nicely. But the body and paint was still in poor condition…peeling and faded. My brother had lined up a couple of potential paint shops in Knoxville, Tennessee where he lived, so the next day we visited them and my next decision had to be made quickly. To complete the refurbishment, I selected an individual (Sam Thompson) that did paint and body work from a shop at his home in the small community of Mascot, Tennessee. Over a period of six months Sam hand-stripped the car, polished the trim, removed all the old body work and filler and re-straightened the body and refit the panels, doors, trunk and hood. Then he painted it the original silver color, with the black patches on the hood that I had painted on following high school. Many folks think this design came from the Plymouth Road Runners of the era, but it is actually copied from my very first car, a 1967 Opel Kadett “Rallye”. Purists don’t like those black patches on my Fairlane because they are not original, but I do and I wanted to keep looking like I had it way back when.</p>

		<p>In April of 2003, Sam was finished with the body and paint work on the car. My son Taylor and I traveled by air from Los Angeles to Tennessee to pick it up and make the trip west. Sam, like Bob, had performed almost a miracle on the old Fairlane. It looked better than I had ever remembered it. The car now looked as good as it drove. Just fantastic!</p>

		<p>The first day, Taylor and I left bright and early. I had asked Taylor if he wanted to head straight west from Nashville and pick up Route 66 in Tulsa, but he said “No, Route 66 starts in Chicago, so that is where WE should start!” So we drove the 500 miles from Nashville to Chicago on the first day of our trip. We were going to travel as much of Route 66 as possible on the way back to Los Angeles. The car performed perfectly, running smoothly and powerfully. Taylor was learning to drive (he was not yet 16) so he had quite an adventure helping me drive the car out to California. I’ll never forget the first time he took the wheel on an on-ramp in Tennessee as we headed out for Chicago. He was scared and excited at the same time (as I surely would have been at that age!)<p>

		<p>We drove Route 66 through Illinois, Missouri, Kansas (all 13 miles of Route 66 in Kansas!), Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. It was a fantastic trip with my son, one that I will remember forever. We had great conversations and a wonderful time together.</p>
		<div id="imgright"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_05.jpg"></div>
		<p>Soon before we left on the trip, I posted our plans on the “FE Forum”. Much to my surprise, many of the forum members piped up with an offer to stop by on our way through their town. So we had the extreme pleasure to visit with friends from the FE Forum (and usually THEIR friends and family) along the way. This turned out be one of the best parts of the trip…meeting up with other FE powered Ford enthusiasts in the heartland. We met up with “FE folks” in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.</p>

		<p>We visited all kinds of interesting sites along Route 66, like the original Corn Dog stand in Springfield, Illinois, “Devil’s Elbow” in Missouri, the Route 66 Museum in Oklahoma, Cadillac Ranch outside Amarillo, Texas, and many old and interesting sections of the “Mother Road”. Some of the best parts were the old sections of four-lane highway that were essentially abandoned to I-40 just a short distance away. It was odd, but neat, to see the abandoned gas stations from the 40’s and 50’s, the old dilapidated and disintegrating motels, and very old “alignments” of the highway.</p>

		<p>We only had one full week to do this trip (Taylor’s “Spring Break” from school), but it would have been far better to take two or three weeks to do it “right”. We had special maps showing all the old and original sections of Route 66 along the way, and how and when to access them. We originally wanted to use these original parts of Route 66 almost exclusively and only get on the Interstate Highway when we needed to make up time. But it turned out to be the opposite…we were using the interstate primarily, and getting off on Route 66 when and where we could, for short distances. This was due to two reasons: one, we were spending a lot of time visiting with our new friends from the FE Forum, and that was great. The second reason was a problem with the car. Right after leaving Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas, the car suddenly quit running! The engine would sporadically just quit while driving down the road, and then mysteriously restart when we would turn the ignition key off, then on again. The problem seems obvious now, but it turned out to be a faulty ignition switch that we repaired upon our return. We tried various fixes along the way (all unsuccessful) but the intermittent problem caused us to be cautious about getting too far from the main highway lest we become disabled. We had a couple of memorable backfires and muffler blow-outs from these “running restarts”! Otherwise the trip was a purely wonderful event for us in virtually every way.</p>
		<div id="imgleft"><img src="images/pictures/fairlane_06.jpg"></div>
		<p>An interesting note: during the last three days of our trip, when we were experiencing the problem with the car, I would hook up my laptop computer each night in the motel room and e-mail the FE Forum with my problem and the solutions tried that day. By morning the forum members had responded with ideas and other fixes to try. How cool is that? A veritable phalanx of Ford engine experts all across the country to mine for information and experience! All at the touch of a few buttons from the convenience of my motel room. Very, very, cool.</p>
		
		<p>Now the Fairlane is at our home in California, performing some informal cruising duties and waiting for Taylor to get his license. We plan for him to drive it to high school, just like his Dad did! And we owe it all to Bob Mannel and the Fairlane Club of America. Like Bob said in one of his club magazine editorials, the Fairlane Club of America is all about members helping members keep these great cars on the road. And like I said, he talks the talk and he walks the walk! Thank you, Bob!</p>
